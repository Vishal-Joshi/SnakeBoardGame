The board Configuration are as follows-
# Its a board of 10 rows and 10 columns which makes it a 10*10 board
# The board consists of 7 snakes and 8 ladders
# The game will be played currently by 1 player. (In future, will expand it to 2 players)

Its an initial draft of the game which currently resides in my head in the way I used to play in my
childhood :) Please don't mind if I was breaking some rules!
